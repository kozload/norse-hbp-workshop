# norse-hbp-workshop

This workshop will teach you to quickly solve interesting
problems using the spiking neural network library, Norse. Norse
lets you do deep-learning with spiking neural networks.
It provides simple bio-inspired neuron models which
are integrated into PyTorch, a popular deep learning library.
This allows you to develop large scale deep-learning models
with spiking neurons quickly.


## Overview of Workshop Notebooks

- Encoding - experiment with encoding of data to spikes 
- High Performance Computing - learn how to train spiking neuron models with PyTorch Lightning and scale to HPC
- Single Neuron Experiments - learn more about Norse by experimenting with a single neuron
- Stochastic Computing - explore stochastic computing with spiking neurons
- Parameter Learning - explore how to optimise neuron parameters

You are also encouraged to explore the other example [tasks](https://github.com/norse/norse/task/) and
tutorial [notebooks](https://github.com/norse/notebooks/), aswell as our [documentation](https://norse.ai/docs).
