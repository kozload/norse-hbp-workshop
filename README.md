# norse-hbp-workshop

This workshop will teach you to quickly solve interesting
problems using the spiking neural network library, Norse. Norse
lets you do deep-learning with spiking neural networks.
It provides simple bio-inspired neuron models which
are integrated into PyTorch, a popular deep learning library.
This allows you to develop large scale deep-learning models
with spiking neurons quickly.
We will start with a brief hands-on introduction that
explain the basics of the library and get you from zero
to a training model within minutes. Subsequently, we will break
out into smaller groups centered on topics of interest
to workshop participants. Suggested topics are: Event based
vision processing, (meta-)plasticity, reinforcement learning,
and memory.
