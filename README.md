# norse-hbp-workshop

This workshop will let you explore Norse. Norse
lets you do deep-learning with spiking neural networks.
It provides simple bio-inspired neuron models which
are integrated into PyTorch, a popular deep learning library.
This allows you to develop large scale deep-learning models
with spiking neurons quickly.

## Overview of Workshop Notebooks

- Encoding - experiment with encoding of data to spikes [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/norse/norse-hbp-workshop/blob/master/encoding.ipynb)
- High Performance Computing - train models with PyTorch Lightning and learn how to scale to HPC [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/norse/norse-hbp-workshop/blob/master/high-performance-computing.ipynb)
- Single Neuron Experiments - learn more about Norse by experimenting with a single neuron [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/norse/norse-hbp-workshop/blob/master/single-neuron-experiments.ipynb)
